Thanks for downloading FastSemSim.

To install it, make sure you have Python>=2.5.
WxWidgets library is required to run the graphical user interface.

Then run this command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install


To run the graphical user interface:
	- Linux and OS X users: run fastSemSimGui.sh, located in the main folder. It should work either you installed the library or not
	- Windows users: run fastSemSimGui.bat, located in the main folder. It should work either you installed the library or not

	Note for Linux and OS X users: in some systems the Python interpreter has to be invoked using the command 'python2' instead of 'python'. You might need to modify the fastSemSimGui.sh script accordingly.

For more detailed instructions, see the documentation available online.
