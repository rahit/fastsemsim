FastSemSim library
==================

The FastSemSim Python package implements 

* a set of classes to represent and reason with ontologies (e.g. Gene Ontology)

* a set of classes to represent and reason on ACs

* the algorithms to calculate semantic similarity measures

Ontologies
----------------------------------
Algorithms and data structure to parse and represent ontologies, and exctract information from them.

----------------------------------
Algorithms and data structure to parse and represent ACs, and exctract information from them.
