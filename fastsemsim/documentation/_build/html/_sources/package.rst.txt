FastSemSim package
==================

The FastSemSim Python package implements 
- a set of classes to represent and reason with ontologies (e.g. Gene Ontology) and annotation corpora
- the algorithms to calculate multiple semantic similarity measures

This documentation explains how to start and use FastSemSim in your Python programs and scripts.
The materials here presented are divided in four sections

The standard processing workflow used when calculating semantic similarity scores can be recapitulated in the following 6 steps:

Handling and playing with Ontologies (in particular, with the Gene Ontology)
----------------------------------
All the classes required to handle ontologies are defined in the Ontology component of fastSemSim.

After importing fastsemsim, you can load an ontology using the function load_ontology()

import fastsemsim
ontology = fastsemsim.load_ontology()

If invoked without parameters, this function will load the Gene Ontology shipped with fastsemsim.
Playing with the parameters of the function allows loading other ontologies included in fastsemsim, as well as custom ontologies from obo or xml files.

To list the ontologies available in fastsemsim, you can use the function list_ontologies()



Representing and using with Annotation Corpora
----------------------------------

Putting all together: calculating semantic similarities
----------------------------------


Divers
----------------------------------

The CLI main function is  designed to evaluate semantic similarity scores.

It currently allows to load an arbitrary obo ontology and annotation corpus. If no custom ontology is provided, the embedded version will be  used.
