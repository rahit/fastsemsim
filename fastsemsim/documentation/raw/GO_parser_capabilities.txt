[FEATURES]

- The parser handles obo-xml files (also the gzipped version, no need to decompress)
- The relations between GO Terms currently considered are: is_a, part_of, regulates, positively_regulates, negatively_regulates

[DATA AVAILABLE AFTER PARSING (partly provided by fastSemSimUtils.py - ask Tiziana)]

- direct children of a Term [Python dict. (Key=GO Term, Value= dict of children).]
- direct ancestors of a Term [Python dict. (Key=GO Term, Value= dict of parents).]
- all the ancestors of a Term [Python dict. (Key=GO Term, Value= dict of all the ancestors).]
- all the descendants of a Term [Python dict. (Key=GO Term, Value= dict of all the descendants).]
- alternative Terms [Python dict. (Key=Alternative GO Term, Value=GO Term).]
- obsolete Terms [Python dict. If a GO Term is in this dict, then it is obsolete]
- GO Term frequency in the annotation corpus
- GO Term Information Content (for the annotation corpus)


[How Annotations are handled]

- Annotations involving Alternative GO Terms are merged together using the main GO Term [good for IC calculation]
- Annotations involving obsolete GO Terms are discarded
