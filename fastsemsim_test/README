fastsemsim_test folder

This folder contains scripts for testing fastSemSim.
Run the script within this folder, otherwise they'll complain about missing data.

If the fastSemSim library has not been installed, the path to the local folder containing the source code of fastsemsim has to be added to PYTHONPATH (using the export shell command).

Example: if fastSemSim has been downloaded in the folder with path '~/fastsemsim', you should use
	
	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:'~/fastsemsim'

before executing the test scripts.

Under Windows, set the python library path variable from Control Panel.

If you installed fastSemSim, you should be able to run any test script without setting any path.
