fastSemSim is a tool to efficiently determine semantic similarity between gene products
A coprehensive manual of the tool is not available yet.
In this build there are some useful examples though.

testSemSim.sh is a example illustrating how to use fastSemSim library. It takes as input the Gene Ontology (in XML format), an annotation corpus (in GOA format), and a list of pairs of objects (proteins) to compare.
It stores in log.txt the semantic similarity scores between proteins listed in the file passed as third parameter.

fastSemSimGui.sh launches a gui (graphical user interface) that allows to calculate semantic similarity scores using fastSemSim library.
