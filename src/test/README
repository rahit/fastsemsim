This folder contains some test programs.
You can run these programs to check whether fastSemSim is working correctly.
Please run these programs from the test folder (or they'll complain about missing data).

If you have not installed fastSemSim library, you should add the local path to the library.
For example: if you are running test_sem_sim.py from the test folder, you should type

	export PYTHONPATH=..

at the prompt, before executing the Python script.
In Windows you should set the python library path variable.
The procedure may vary according to whether or not you are using the Python graphical interface.
