[[test folder]]

This folder contains scripts for testing whether fastSemSim works correctly.
They must be run from within this folder (otherwise they'll complain about missing data).

If fastSemSim library has not been installed, the local path to the library should be added to PYTHONPATH.
Example: if running test_sem_sim.py from within this folder, use

	export PYTHONPATH=..

before executing the Python script.
Under Windows set the python library path variable from Control Panel.
